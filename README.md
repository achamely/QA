QA
==

This repository contains Quality Assurance artifacts (processes, master test plans, resources available, etc)
for the Mastercoin Distributed Exchange. It's forked from https://github.com/bitcoin/QA by [gavinandresen](https://github.com/gavinandresen).

[Mastercoin Distributed Exchange Test Plan](https://github.com/marv-engine/QA/blob/master/MastercoinDistributedExchangeTestPlan.md) describes the testing strategy we are using.

If you are a developer or QA lead, also read
[TestPlanCreation.md](https://github.com/marv-engine/QA/blob/master/TestPlanCreation.md)

If you want to help out (and maybe earn some BTC for testing), then read [TestPlanExecution.md](https://github.com/marv-engine/QA/blob/master/TestPlanExecution.md)
